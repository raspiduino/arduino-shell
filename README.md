# Arduino-shell
A simple Unix-like shell for your Arduino!
This is a very simple shell I have wrote for my Arduino, and I want to share it for you. If you like, you can give it a try! Thanks a lot for that :D
If you want to add something new or report a bug, feel free to tell me!
Support Arduino Uno (ATmega328) or any other AVR cpus!
